This affects common configurations and which are also likely to be exploitable. Examples include significant disclosure of the contents of server memory (potentially revealing user details), vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited remotely to compromise server private keys or where remote code execution is considered likely in common situations. These issues will be kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported versions. We will attempt to address these as soon as possible.

PrintNanny is deployed to <strong>hundreds of Raspberry Pis</strong> around the world.</p><p>When OpenSSL 3.0.7 is released, affected Pis will require a security update - but we've made the process easy!

Swupdate is an over-the-air (OTA) update system for internet-of-things (IoT) devices. </p><p>Over-the-air software updates keep car computers, smart appliances, and other IoT devices current with the latest security fixes.</p><p>My favorite part of PrintNanny OS's updater is the <strong>A/B</strong> partition scheme, which means I always have a safe rollback option. </p><p>Before I integrated swupdate, I had to run a configuration management tool (like Ansible) or re-image my Raspberry Pis to restore a previous state. The A/B partition strategy is so much more reliable!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="PrintNanny Over-the-air updates" src="/assets/images/update-printnanny-os-aaa4a36c18bf9fc26d118650e620137d.gif" width="974" height="721" class="img_ev3q">.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading!<a class="hash-link" href="#thanks-for-reading" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>My name is Leigh, and I'm the creator of PrintNanny.ai.
