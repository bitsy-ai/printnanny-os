### NATS replaces Cloud IoT Core

Earlier this month, [Google Cloud Platform's IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/release-notes) service was **discontinued by Google.**

PrintNanny had used IoT Core's managed MQTT broker and identify (certificate) management system **since launch**.

When Google made the announcement 12 days ago, I migrated PrintNanny's event system to use a [NATS](https://nats.io/) message broker and [NATS Nkeys](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth) for authentication/identity management. You'll notice `printnanny-mqtt.service` has been removed and replaced by `printnanny-nats.service`.

Don't worry! [NATs is able to broker MQTT protocol](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/mqtt), which is a staple in the internet-of-things universe. 

PrintNanny will continue to support **both MQTT and websocket-based events**. üôå

### PrintNanny API Docs

* [https://printnanny.ai/api/schema/swagger-ui/](https://printnanny.ai/api/schema/swagger-ui/) (Swagger)

PrintNanny's API is defined by an [OpenAPI schema](https://openapi-generator.tech/), which is used to generate API client code in Rust, Typescript, and Python.
