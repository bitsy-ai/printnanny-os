### Password-less Login (PrintNanny Cloud)

The response to password-less login for PrintNanny OS was so positive, we've decided to do away with passwords everywhere. 

PrintNanny Cloud now uses a password-less login too. Enter your email address to receive a one-time login code.

### Crash Report

PrintNanny now includes a crash report utility, which can be accessed anytime by clicking the üî• icon in the top-right corner of Mission Control.

You can also submit a crash report from the command line, by running:

```bash
$ printnanny crash-report
```
