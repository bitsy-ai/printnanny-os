## ‚ú® What's New?

Dunite is the largest PrintNanny OS release to date! As usual, you can see detailed development updates in [Github's milestone tracker.](https://github.com/bitsy-ai/printnanny-os/milestone/4?closed=1)

Exciting new updates include:

### Syncthing GA

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) continuously synchronizes files between two or more devices - like a private DropBox. PrintNanny was conceived with privacy in mind, and Syncthing allows us to deliver easy file management without storing your files on our services. 

Follow the setup steps in [https://docs.printnanny.ai/docs/quick-start/configure-file-sync/](Configure File Sync) to get started. [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/sf23bk2hPr) to let us know what you think!

### Mainsail GA

Mainsail is now generally available in PrintNanny OS! Until now, you had to install a nightly dev build to use Mainsail/Moonraker/Klipper.

Follow the [Mainsail configuration guide](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/configuration) guide to configure `mainsail.cfg` and Klipper `printer.cfg` files.

### Universal PrintNanny Image + Main

PrintNanny's "edition" images have been merged. 

Instead of installing a different OctoPrint vs. Mainsail image, you can seamlessly switch between MainSail/OctoPrint on the fly. Try both, and [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/sf23bk2hPr) to let us know whether you prefer OctoPrint, Mainsail, or some other controller software.

### PrintNanny Vision - now 100% offline

Before today, PrintNanny's Quality Control algorithm was split between the Raspberry Pi and remote server (see diagram below).

In v0.4.0, PrintNanny Quality Control runs **entirely on the Raspberry Pi!**.

With PrintNanny's privacy-first approach, the only time your camera data leaves your Raspberry Pi is when YOU start viewing your camera feed via PrintNanny Cloud Dashboard. PrintNanny Cloud allows you to issue commands or view your Raspberry Pi camera from anywhere in the world. PrintNanny will never upload your camera data as a "background" or "always on" monitoring process. 

This means PrintNanny Quality Control system can run without an internet connection, also known as an "air-gapped" system.
